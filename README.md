# 06a-Exercises-Networking

These excercises served as a review and application of what we learned in class. Excercise 1 was pretty straightforward. Excercise 2 I did not know what to do with the last 2 exdamples and the 2nd one was giving me errors that I did not know how to fix. For excercise 3 I was unable to complete the last portion.
